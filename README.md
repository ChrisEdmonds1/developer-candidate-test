## Comments

I moved the rendering client side as I don't have much experience with server side rendering.

Given more time I would use Typescript.

I renamed the "gender" property to "sex" as (at least these days) gender refers to man, woman etc, rather than male or female. I felt I shouldn't modify the database, as renaming properties would likely cause trouble in a real life situation.
